Visualization of economic and patent correlation to predict innovation

This project is adapted from an original group project.

Featured in this repository is the visualization from the project, completed independently after the following:
- Data:
  - Patent: sourced from United States Patent Trademark Office (2001 - 2023)
  - Economic: sourced from Bureau of Economic Analysis
- Alogrithim: once data was prepared, cleaned, and a high correlation between patent and economic data was established, we created an 'innovation score.' The innovation score uses economic predictors to determine which locations expect to see high innovation in the following year (at a county level). Predictions verified by the matching with US Economic Development Administration's Tech Hub designation.
